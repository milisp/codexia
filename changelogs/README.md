# Changelogs

One file per release, newest first. Read the file for the version you care about
rather than scanning everything.

## Older releases

Releases up to and including 0.36.0 live in the root [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md),
which is kept as a frozen archive and is no longer updated. Versions 0.37.0
through 0.41.1 were released without written changelogs; use
`git log v0.36.0..v0.42.0` for that range.

## Conventions

- File name is the version: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>.md`.
- Heading is `# <version> - <YYYY-MM-DD>`, followed by a compare link to the previous release.
- Sections, in this order, omitting any that are empty: `Added`, `Changed`,
  `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`, `Internal`.
- Entries describe what changed for the user, not how it was implemented.
  Commit hashes go in trailing parentheses.
- Changes with no user-visible effect (formatting, tooling, dependency bumps)
  are summarized in a single `Internal` paragraph, not itemized.
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTE.md` holds the prose release note for the *current* release
  only; the release workflow publishes it as the GitHub release body.
